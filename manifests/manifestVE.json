"value": "The February 1848 revolution interrupted the initial phase of writing. La Chambre des Pairs is abolished; Hugo enters the Assemblée Nationale a few months later, dedicating himself to political life, and he stops writing. More than three-quarters of the novel, still called 'Les Misères,'(perhaps in response to Balzac's « Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes ») is already written, even though the overall length barely reaches half of what will be the final volume—this gap is explained by the several developments added later. Through the examination of the manuscript, thanks to the pioneering work of René Journet and Guy Robert, and the new possibilities offered by online publishing, the first draft of the novel and its state at the time of its interruption in February 1848 have been reconstructed by Guy Rosa. This is now the best available edition, both for establishing the text and for studying its genesis, freely accessible.",
